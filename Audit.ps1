ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
The audit.ps1 script performs local security audits on a Windows system. It checks for weak configurations, collects system status info, and reports findings in a readable format (CSV or Markdown).

> Identify gaps against baselines (CIS, NIST 800-53, etc.)
> Provide evidence for compliance or audit purposes
