🔐 Windows Hardening Script Toolkit


🧭 Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to audit and harden Windows systems using PowerShell scripts, aligning with industry-recognized security baselines (like CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIG, or NIST 800-53) to improve system security, support compliance goals, and reduce the attack surface.

 ✅ Key Goals:
 
| Goal                           | Description                                            
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Local Security Auditing** | Automatically gather system info (firewall, accounts, patches, services, etc.) to assess security posture.             |
| **2. Baseline Comparison**     | Compare system settings to known baselines (CIS/NIST) and report gaps.                                                 |
| **3. System Hardening**        | Apply secure configurations via PowerShell to reduce risk and meet compliance goals.                                   |
| **4. GRC Integration**         | Provide documentation that maps each audit or hardening step to security controls (e.g., NIST 800-53 or CIS Controls). |
| **5. Reporting**               | Output results in readable formats (CSV/HTML/Markdown) for team sharing or audit evidence.                             |




🛡️ Why It's Important (Business & Compliance Value):


> Reduces Attack Surface: Many attacks exploit weak system defaults (e.g., open RDP, SMBv1, excessive privileges).

> Supports Compliance: Helps align with frameworks like NIST 800-53, RMF, HIPAA, PCI DSS, or FedRAMP.

> Enables Audit Readiness: Regular system checks and automated reporting make security audits smoother.

> Automates Tedious Work: Manual checks are time-consuming — automation saves time and ensures consistency.

> Bridges Technical & GRC Worlds: Combines scripting with control documentation for ISSOs, system admins, and auditors.
