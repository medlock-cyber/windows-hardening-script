üìÇ scripts/ Folder ‚Äì Why It‚Äôs Important

üîß Technical Perspective

The scripts/ folder holds the PowerShell tools that automate:
> Auditing system configurations
> Hardening the OS
> Running compliance checks consistently across systems

These scripts serve as your automated security engineer, applying policy decisions across multiple machines without human error or inconsistency.

üõ°Ô∏è How It Ties into GRC

‚úÖ Governance

Scripts enforce policies and standards. For example:
> If your policy says ‚ÄúUAC must be enabled,‚Äù 'audit.ps1' checks it, and 'harden.ps1' sets it if missing.
> Ensures technical enforcement of governance decisions.

üìâ Risk Management

Reduces risk by:
> Identifying weak configurations (e.g., open ports, insecure services)
> Applying hardening baselines

Example: If Remote Desktop is enabled on all machines, that's a risk. 'audit.ps1' flags it. 'harden.ps1' can disable it.

üìã Compliance

Maps directly to frameworks like NIST 800-53, CIS Controls, or DISA STIG.
Example:
> NIST Control AC-2 (Account Management) ‚ûù audit.ps1 checks for inactive or excessive local accounts.
> NIST Control SI-2 (Flaw Remediation) ‚ûù Script checks Windows update/hotfix status.

This makes your scripts/ folder a technical proof of compliance tool ‚Äî a key asset for auditors, ISSOs, and security teams.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Automates enforcement     | Ensures governance policy is applied | Checks if firewall is enabled              |
| Detects misconfigurations | Identifies risk conditions           | Alerts if SMBv1 is enabled                 |
| Documents system state    | Provides audit trail                 | CSV report shows current security posture  |
| Applies controls          | Maps to NIST/CIS controls            | `harden.ps1` sets secure registry settings |
